# Pwnisher's "Chasm's Calling" Render Challenge aka "The Panopticon"

This repository contains my submissions for Pwnisher's latest render challenge, "Chasm's Calling."  The challenge prompt revolved around creating a visually compelling scene featuring a sense of depth.

This project explores various concepts and techniques related to environment design, lighting, and storytelling.

## Inspiration and Ideation

I've been listening to the Magnus Archives for YEARS. The power of the Panopticon, the assumption that you're being watched ruling over you, is compelling.

## Development Process

Really, I'm at the every start of my Blender learning journey. Was it more than I could chew? 100%. Would I do it again? Also 100% ðŸ˜…
I've never done much animation work. I've never worked with rigging. I've never done most things. My goal was to just get SOMETHING out there and see where to go from there.

## Renders

The following renders showcase the progress and final result of my work:

Started with the gantry and some really basic lighting. Took onboard the feedback I've seen other participants get - the really effective renders direct your eyes to the important parts. You've only got 6 seconds to work with. It has to read IMMEDIATELY what you're workin with.
