# Pwnisher's "Chasm's Calling" Render Challenge aka "The Panopticon"

This repository contains my submissions for Pwnisher's latest render challenge, "Chasm's Calling."  The challenge prompt revolved around creating a visually compelling scene featuring a sense of depth.

This project explores various concepts and techniques related to environment design, lighting, and storytelling.

## Inspiration and Ideation

I've been listening to the Magnus Archives for YEARS. The power of the Panopticon, the assumption that you're being watched ruling over you, is compelling.

## Development Process

Really, I'm at the every start of my Blender learning journey. Was it more than I could chew? 100%. Would I do it again? Also 100% ðŸ˜…
My goal was to just get SOMETHING out there and see where to go from there.
I know in THEORY that I should just chunk it and steadily work on different components. In reality, I spend a lot of time switching tasks.
One thing I WAS really deliberate to do is whenever I come across a technical challenge, like mastering Instancing, I'd do it in a scratch project so I wasn't getting confused.

## Renders

The following renders showcase the progress and final result of my work:

Started with the gantry and some really basic lighting. Took onboard the feedback I've seen other participants get - the really effective renders direct your eyes to the important parts. You've only got 6 seconds to work with. It has to read IMMEDIATELY what you're workin with.

## Challenges and Learnings

Initial Challenges:
*   I didn't know how to animate
*   I didn't know how to do environmental explosions
*   I've never dealt the rigged characters before
*   I don't know what I'm doing ðŸ˜…
<!-- This challenge presented several interesting hurdles, particularly [mention any specific challenges you faced, e.g., optimizing the scene, creating realistic textures, achieving the desired mood, etc.].  Overcoming these challenges allowed me to learn [mention what you learned, e.g., new techniques, improved workflow, etc.]. -->

## Dev Log

### 2025-02-12 22:00 PM ~4hrs today ooft
* Cleaned up structure of assets
* Pivoting idea: no longer a prison riot (beyond my scope) but a prison BREAK might be possible...
* Set up gantry around the perimeter of each level
* Replaced eye with something custom - will have mechanical parts instead of an optical fibre I reckon
* Fixed an issue with my z array modifier on the gantries - a pesky x offset that didn't belong
* Placeholder door that will DEFINITELY need replacing
* Started setting out paths for the rocket troopers to follow
* Found an excellent [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5lyXS-uhyI) that FINALLY taught me how to make an cool mechanical iris after getting VERY confused for a long time.
* Made an iris and blackplate
* Gave my rocket trooper temporary jet plumes

### 2025-02-11 22:00PM ~2.5hr session
* Initial blockout of central column and cells
* Made a simple cell with a weak area light in the ceiling
* Instanced around to form the array of cells
* Applied basic materials
* Gantry work with strip lighting - duplicated for depth
* Some really basic lighting of the character
* Downloaded a big weird eye - not a fan
