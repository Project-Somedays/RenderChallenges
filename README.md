# RenderChallenges
Pwnisher's render challenges on YouTube/discord are just a brilliant avenue for creativity... Each one ends up being about 30 years worth of collective effort from hundreds of artists from all around the world condensed down into a montage of 6 second clips and showcasing the best of 3D story-telling I've seen. Excited to be involved!
